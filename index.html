    <h2>Me like Games</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Games are Kool, and the one I like most is MINECRAFT. Minecraft is a
      sandbox game, so you can do whatever you want to do with it. You can build
      amazing structures, defeat the final boss, and tons of other things. But I
      like BLOWING STUFF UP!

    <h2>Me like Food</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Food is very yum. The most extremely yum food is Ramen. It is easy to make
      and good to have as a late night snack while watching Netflix. Ther are
      many kinds of Ramen, and many distinct flavours. Some of the are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Seafood</li>
      <li>Beef</li>
      <li>And MANY more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Me like Read</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Reading is Sooper Kool, and Fantasy realted genres usually catch my eye. I
      read as a way to pleasantly pass the time, especially during bus rides to
      and from my school. I have shifted my attention to reading manga, which is
      a form of Japanese comics.
